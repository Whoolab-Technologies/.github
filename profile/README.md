## 🏗️ Featured Open-Source Platform  
### Centralized Multi-Store Inventory Management System

A modular inventory platform designed for organizations operating across
multiple project sites or stores — such as construction companies,
infrastructure projects, or warehouse-based businesses.

The platform supports:

- Central + sub-store inventory model
- Store-to-store transfers
- MR (Material Request) workflows for engineers
- PR (Purchase Request) workflows for stock-out situations
- Transaction lifecycle statuses  
  (`processing`, `in-transfer`, `delivered`, etc.)
- Material consumption & accountability
- Return workflows (site → store → central)
- Auto-generated QR codes for all items
- QR scanning across operational workflows
- Role-based access for engineers & storekeepers
